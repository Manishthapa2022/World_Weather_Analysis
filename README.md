____

In the Challenge, we are required to collect and analyize weather data accross cities worldwide, so that Plan My Trip can use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on client weather preferences. As this is a new product, wee have Bets testers involved and they will choose four cities from a list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Goole Maps Direction API, we will create a travel route between four cities and a marker layer map.
